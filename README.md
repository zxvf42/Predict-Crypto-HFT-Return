# How and When are High-Frequency Crypto Returns Predictable?

This is a toy project based on and containing some code implementations of parts from the  work by Aït-Sahalia et al. (2022)[^1].

The main purpose of this project is to study the predictability of high-frequency crypto returns (in an ideal offline research environment). This project is not intended to be a practical trading strategy, but rather a simple demonstration for research purpose. It is also a practice of analyzing the high-frequency order book and trades data of cryptocurrencies.

We also discussed the possible assumptions and limitations, as well as why a real world agent can barely benefit from such kinds of predictions and then monetize. The demonstration may give out some simple insights and ideas for further research.
